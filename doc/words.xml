<Heading>Words as list of integers</Heading>
In <Package>SgpDec</Package> words are dense lists of positive integers. There is no type information defined for words, the interpretation of the positive integer numbers, whether they are transformations or symbols is done by the functions below. Negative integers code the inverse of the corresponding permutation. This makes handling words very flexible, but of course there is some danger of misinterpreting a given integer sequence or overindexing.
