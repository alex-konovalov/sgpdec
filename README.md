# SgpDec: Hierarchical Composition and Decomposition of Permutation Groups and Transformation Semigroups

## What is it good for?
Understanding the structure of finite computations. In the long run, it is meant to be game changing in artificial intelligence, systems biology, physics, or in any field where models with discrete states make sense.

For a lightweight popular science style reading on computational semigroup theory check the computational semigroup theory blog (https://compsemi.wordpress.com/).

## How to use it?

You need the latest version of the GAP computer algebra system (https://github.com/gap-system/gap).

To get some idea what SgpDec is capable of, check this paper: SgpDec: Cascade (De)Compositions of Finite Transformation Semigroups and Permutation Groups (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-44199-2_13). For further details the documentation should be helpful.
